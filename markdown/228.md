# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This is my first solution uploaded. As a non-native English speaker, I would be grateful for any clarifications—thank you in advance!  
* Among the requirements of the question, it’s necessary to *determine whether a number belongs to a continuous interval* to decide if "->" should be included.
    1. The `start` variable is a `list[int]` containing one or two elements. The first element indicates the start of the continuous range, while the second element verifies and updates the endpoint, resulting in an interval of continuous numbers.
    2. To ascertain if a number fits within a continuous interval, check the length of `start`. If it contains **two elements**, it signifies *a continuous interval*, and it should **place "->"** between them.
    3. In contrast, if it holds only **one element**, that number indicates *a discontinuous interval*, which is **only converted** to `str` and adds to `result`.
* It was later discovered that `start` only records the starting point of a continuous interval.
    1. Traverse the list until a discontinuity is found, comparing whether the two numbers are identical since the elements of `nums` are sorted and unique.
    2. If `start` **matches** the current number being traversed, it indicates *a discontinuity*; 
    3. if they **differ**, it marks the endpoint of the *continuous interval*, with `start` as the beginning.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Begin by assigning the first element of `nums` to `start`. Utilize `enumerate` to obtain both the index and value after slicing `nums` to stagger them.
2. The expression `index, value = enumerate(nums[1:])[0]` judges that `nums[index]` is the value just before `value`, which aids in determining whether it is part of a consecutive interval.
3. When a break in continuity is detected, and if `start` **equals** the prior value, `nums[index]`, it indicates that `start` signifies *a distinct number*; **conversely**, it denotes *a contiguous range* of numbers.
4. Finally, use `value` as the initial value for the new interval.

# Code
```py
class Solution:
    def summaryRanges(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        if nums == []:
            return []

        result: list[str] = []
        start: int = nums[0]
        nums.append(nums[-1])  #add 1 more check for the final element

        for index, number in enumerate(nums[1:]):    
            #check `nums[index - 1]` with `nums[index]` which is `number`
            if nums[index] + 1 != number:    #find inconsecutive number
                result.append(
                    str(start) if start == nums[index]    #inconsecutive case
                    else f"{start}->{nums[index]}"    #consecutive number
                )

                start = number    #update the beginning of the interval

        return result
```

## below using `list` to record the range of interval
```py
class Solution:
    def add_consecutive_number(self, result: list[str], interval: list[int]
                               ) -> list[str]:
        match len(interval):
            case 1:
                result.append(str(interval[0]))
            case 2:
                result.append("->".join(map(str, interval)))

        return result

    def summaryRanges(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[str]:
        if nums == []:
            return []

        result: list[str] = []
        interval: list[int] = [nums[0]]  #[left_number, right_number]

        for number in nums[1:]:
            if number - 1 == interval[0]:
                interval.append(number)  #right_number
            elif len(interval) == 2 and number - 1 == interval[1]:
                interval[1] = number    #update right_number
            else:    #find inconsecutive number
                result = self.add_consecutive_number(result, interval)

                interval.clear()    #initialize
                interval.append(number)  #add current left_number

        return self.add_consecutive_number(result, interval)  #final case
```
