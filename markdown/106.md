# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
When I initially encountered this type of question, specifically question 105, I was completely lost and struggled to solve it using a while-loop and understanding the relationship between the two inputs provided.  
Subsequently, I discovered from the [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/solutions/5632202/video-2-solutions-with-o-n-2-and-o-n-time) to question 105 that `list.pop(0)` was used to obtain *preorder* for `TreeNode`, while question 106 relied on `list.pop()` to retrieve the *postorder*.  
The traversal orders are defined as follows:
* preorder: **root -> left** -> right
* inorder: ***left -> root*** -> right

In 105, get root in order at the **head** of *preorder* and check whether there is `root.left` in *inorder* according to the index of its value.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The traversal orders are defined as follows:
* postorder: left -> **right -> root**
* inorder: left -> ***root -> right***

To identify the root at the **end** of *postorder* list, check for `root.right` in *inorder* array using its valueâ€™s index.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, inorder: list[int], postorder: list[int]
                  ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Using a hashtable to find the index of `TreeNode.val` with O(1).
        # Without the hashtable, using `list.index(TreeNode.val)` is O(n).
        INORDER_VAL_TO_INDEX: dict[int, int] = {
            value: index for index, value in enumerate(inorder)
        }

        def build(start: int, end: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
            """two-pointer to determine the range of the elements in `inorder`

            Args:
                start (int): the beginning index of the subtree
                end (int): the last index of the subtree

            Returns:
                Optional[TreeNode]: the node, `root` of tree/subtree
            """
            if start > end:
                return None

            root: TreeNode = TreeNode(postorder.pop())      #build `TreeNode`
            middle: int = INORDER_VAL_TO_INDEX[root.val]    #index of `root`

            # Recursive except `middle` because it is the root of the subtree.
            root.right = build(middle + 1, end)
            root.left = build(start, middle - 1)

            return root

        return build(0, len(postorder) - 1)
