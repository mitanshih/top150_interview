array/string: observe carefully, there always exist some rules
two-pointer: set two-pointer at the beginning and the end
sliding windows: set the index of left window and forward traversal, 
    then move the left window while the condition is satisfied
matrix: try another bit or bit mask to solve in-place
-
solved: 22/150
-
hashmap: careful the length of iterable while transforming to set
intervals: overlapping or non-overlapping on the interval, 
    often appearing on the first element with the initial condition
-
solved: 35/150
-
stack: focus on the order of elements in the stack
linked-list: it always traverses in one direction. 
    If the modification operates outside `current`, 
    set a pointer to record the head before iterating.
